The program `HeatEqnCrank.cpp` uses gsl library to solve one dimensional Heat Equation using Crank-Nicholson scheme.

A two dimensional Dffusion equation is solved in the program `2dDiffusionCrank.cpp`. The same equation is also solved using another method that empolys forward-time-Central-Space scheme. The two results are compared and the results are shown in the pdf file DiffusionEqn.pdf .
